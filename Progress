4/2/15: This is the original project (pre-GitHub)
  - General Desc
      - So far the user is able to create shape (quadrilaterals) and edit a limited amount of properties of the custom shapes they create
      - Hitting the [Tab] key will hide any present menus (except for when in the main menu)
      - Left clicking on a created shape allows the user to move the shapes position(x, y)
      - Right clicking on a created shape brings up a quick menu that allows the user to edit the shape's properties
